# 🛡️ Courage's Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my ethical cybersecurity journey.

## 👋 About Me

Born and raised in Nigeria, I had little access to computers growing up - but I never lacked curiosity or drive. I taught myself personal training, built a coaching business as a Fitness Trainer in Dubai and subsequently scaled to online coaching - now based in NYC, and earned certifications from Active IQ and NASM. I’ve completed CPD courses in:

- Trigger Point Therapy  
- Functional Stick Mobility  
- NASM Nutrition  
- Advanced Boxing for Fitness  
- NASM Stretch & Flexibility Coach  
- NASM Corrective Exercise Specialist
- I had just concluded the Google Cybersecurity professional certificate credential
- Next up is the compTIA security+ certificate 

Each step reflects my commitment to continous learning and dedication to serving others more effectively.

## 🔐 Why Cybersecurity?

My interest sparked after the arrest of “Hushpuppy,” a Nigerian cybercriminal who stole funds meant for sick people. As someone who values health and integrity, I asked: *How can I help protect others from digital harm?* That question led me to cybersecurity—and I’ve been hooked ever since.

## 🎯 My Mission

I aim to be part of the digital defense line, especially for communities like mine in Nigeria where scams are rampant. I bring the same grit, ethics, and client-first mindset from my coaching career into cybersecurity.

## 💼 What I Offer

- A proven track record of continous learning  
- A values-driven approach to ethical cybersecurity  
- A passion for protecting people from exploitation  
- A commitment to mastering foundational skills and contributing meaningfully to the cyberlandscape
